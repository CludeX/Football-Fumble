Football-Fumble
===============

Android game

A soccer game where the user can play against an AI character. They then enter a team name and match time (or select from predefined matches). Each team has 3-5 players to avoid overcrowding of the screen.

When the match starts, the users player starts off with the ball. He/she must get to the other side of the field and kick the ball (by pressing a button) into the goal. Meanwhile, the other team is trying to get the ball of the user by staying within a certain radius around the player. After a certain amount of time, or if there are many players within the radius, then the user loses the ball to one of the other players. The user must try and regain the ball by doing the same with the player with the ball.

The player with the ball can pass it to a team member, but only if they are open i.e. there are no opposing team members blocking the way. To kick the ball, the user presses a button. The ball will travel in the direction in which the user is running. To dribble the ball, the user needs to run in their intended direction and the ball must be continuously kicked.

To take a shot at goal, the user must tap the goal, and then the same view is changed to 1st person. They then must tap which part of the goal in which to shoot. If the user looses the ball, then the view is changed back to birds eye view.

When a goal is scored, the players are reset to their starting positions and the other team (team which was scored against) starts with the ball. Once the timer is up, the winner is the team with the most goals.
