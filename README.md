Football Fumble is a physics based football game. Upon starting the game, users will have the option of a 'Quick Match' or to 'Start a New Game'. 'Quick Match' will randomly select parameters and will put the user right into the action. This is perfect for the type of audience this will be marketed to. In 'Start a New Game', users will be able to change some options, such as the powerups that will appear, length of the game, and their team colour.

The game will feature are more arcade-driven playstyle than other football games, due to the way the player interacts with the ball, and the inclusion of a powerup system. Instead of the ball being tied to a player and then pressing pressing some sequence to perform an action (tap the screen to pass the ball), the ball is seperate from the characters at all times. For a charcter to kick the ball in some direction speed and direction must be taken into account, as the balls direction and speed depend on the collisions it has with other objects on the field.

The powerup system is designed to make each game unique and engaging. They will be able to change various things for short period, such as making the player run faster, making the player kick the ball harder and various others. Players will be able to save their highscores and compare them to other players who have played the game. There will be a global highscore which users can compare against one another (provided an internet connection is available) and also a local highscore.

 

 

Key Differences:

Powerup System
Powerups will spawn at random times during each game. These enhance the arcade feeling of the game and push it more towards a market aimed at the user who wants to spend 5-10 minutes playing a match.


Rules and Scoring
The scoring system is less rigid than traditional football games. Points aren't awarded just for scoring goals, but also in the manner that goals are scored. More points may be added for a fast goal score, or if the ball was deflected off a wall. This game will relax the rules of football more. To make the game more suitable as a small 'timewaster' outs, corners, and other events which would slow the action have been removed, and instead edges will be isnerted where the ball can bounce off; keeping the ball in play at all times, ready to go.

Physics
Players will not interact with the ball as a traditional Football sim. Instead of having the ball attach to a current player the ball is considered a free object, and it's movement will depend on the collisions which occur between itself and other players. The balls movement and speed will depend on the player who 'kicked' the ball. This wil give the game a fresh new dynamic, playing football will be new and refreshing.
